/**
 * POV filter verbs — perception/cognition verbs that put the narrator
 * between the reader and the experience ("she saw the door open" → "the
 * door opened"). Each entry has a note the tooltip will display.
 *
 * Intensifiers, hedges and filler ("very", "quite", "just") used to live
 * here too. They are Harper's job now (boring_words, filler_words, hedging);
 * this plugin keeps the checks a grammar checker doesn't make.
